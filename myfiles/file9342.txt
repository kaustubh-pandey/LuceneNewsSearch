Rep. Hakeem Jeffries ( ) said Saturday in an interview on MSNBC that the country was in the “midst of a constitutional crisis,” and added that President Donald Trump’s decision last week to fire FBI Director James Comey was “an urgent threat to our democracy. ”  “We are in the midst of a constitutional crisis  —   the likes of which we have not seen in this country since the days of Watergate and Richard Nixon,” Jeffries argued. “The firing of [James Comey] who was overseeing a criminal investigation to implicate the president of the United States is an urgent threat to our democracy, our way of life and our values. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
