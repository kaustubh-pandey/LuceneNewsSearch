“Saturday Night Live” ended its first   show with Cecily Strong, later joined by Sasheer Zamata, singing Lulu’s “To Sir, With Love” as tribute to the former president.  At the end, the two offered up a mug to Obama that says, “World’s Best President. ” Zamata then pled, “Don’t go!” right before “Thank You President Obama” appeared on the screen.
