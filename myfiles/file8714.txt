Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” former communications chief for President George W. Bush Nicolle Wallace said   Donald Trump “bullies female reporters at his rally as an applause line. ”  Wallace said, “We have just elected a man who bullies female reporters at his rally as an applause line. We have just elected a man who started a hot war with a female anchor instead of attending a debate she moderated. We are in a new place. And I don’t think it’s good. And I don’t think it has any parallels to the past. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
